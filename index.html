        <h3> Food Access</h3>
        <p> The Bronx has the highest rates of food insecurity within the five boroughs of New York City. An estimated 25% of Bronx residents were considered food insecure as of 2019, though that number is expected to rise in the era of Covid-19.
          Additionally, much of the northwest Bronx is considered a “food desert,” with a limited availability of places to buy fresh produce and other nutritional foods. </p>

        <h3> Wealth Disparity</h3>
        <p>According to a report from the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, residents within the northwest and south Bronx have the lowest median incomes within the city. In the northwest Bronx, median incomes are between 27% to
          37% of Area Median Income (AMI). The median household income in 2018 was roughly $38,000.00. The northwest Bronx has the highest rates of evictions, rent burden, serious housing violations, and percent increase in residential sales prices
          within the city. These factors have created situations of extreme precarity for many northwest Bronx residents. </p>

        <h3> COVID-19</h3>
        <p>Before the Covid-19 pandemic, an estimated 37 million people in the United States were food insecure. Estimates for how many more people are now food insecure range between 9 to 17 million. The northwest Bronx is one of the areas hit
          hardest by the pandemic, which has exacerbated economic insecurities and associated health risks for communities. </p>

        <h3> Community Response </h3>
        <p>Community groups across the northwest Bronx have been actively providing food assistance for years through food pantries, community gardens, and direct food deliveries. As Covid-19 has brought compounding health and economic challenges,
          these groups have responded with increased levels of support for their communities. The NW Bronx Food Justice Project is a coalition of organizations that are working to end hunger within the Bronx. The coalition includes Riverdale Senior
          Services, Kingsbridge Heights Community Center, Outer Seed Shadow, St. Stephen’s United Methodist Church, the Marble Hill Community Center, and the Schervier Apartments. Another group, the Albanian American Open Hand Association,
          distributes roughly 1000 meals a day to families and seniors across the Bronx. </p>
